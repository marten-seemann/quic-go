# first part of the GOARCH workaround
# setting the GOARCH directly doesn't work, since the value will be overwritten later
# so set it to a temporary environment variable first
env:
  - TRAVIS_GOARCH=amd64
  - TRAVIS_GOARCH=386

# second part of the GOARCH workaround
# now actually set the GOARCH env variable to the value of the temporary variable set earlier
before_install:
  - export GOARCH=$TRAVIS_GOARCH
  - go env # for debugging
